	<h2>Basic Information</h2>
	<p><b>The dhole(Cuon alpinus)</b> is a canid native to Central, South and Southeast Asia.
    Other English names for the species include <b>Asiatic wild dog</b>, <b>Indian wild dog</b>,
    <b>whistling dog</b>, <b>red dog</b>, and <b>mountain wolf</b>. Found in eastern and southern 
    Asia, from Siberia in the north to the Malay Peninsula in the south, dholes occupy a wide
    variety of climates and habitats, including dense forests, scrub, steppes, and alpine regions.
    They vary in color from charcoal gray to rust red to sandy beige, depending on their habitat.
    Their tail is brushy and fox-like, often with a black tip. These wild dogs usually have a
    white belly, chest, and feet, but not always. </p>

 <h2>Social animal</h2>
 <p>Living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple 
	breeding females. Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 
	are known. It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets medium and large 
	sized ungulates. In tropical forests, the dhole competes with tigers and leopards, targeting
	somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.</p>

 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>The species was first described in European literature in 1794 by an explorer named Pesteref,
    who encountered dholes during his travels in far eastern Russia. He described the animal as 
 being a regular pack hunter of Alpine ibex, and of bearing many similarities with the golden 
 jackal.</p>

 <h2>Why endangered?</h2>
 <p>Main threats to the species include ongoing habitat loss, depletion of prey base, persecution
    and possibly disease transfer from domestic and feral dogs. The main prey for the dhole are ungulates,
    which have also suffered high depletion of their population across the dhole's range.</p>

 <h2>How to save Dhole?</h2>
 <p>Though it's been illegal to kill a dhole since the early 1970s, people are still doing 
 it out of fear that the wild dogs are threatening livestock. There has been some pressure 
 on the Indian government to make penalties stiffer for said acts. The World Wildlife Fund 
 has taken the approach that locals will care about saving the dhole only if they see economic
 benefits, so the WWF is assisting in the development of an ecotourism venture in Cambodia’s 
 Srepok River Area.</p>
