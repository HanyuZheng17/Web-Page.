        <h1>Welcome to Mayapan Mexico</h1>
        <hr />
        
        <p><strong>Mayapan</strong> is a Pre-Columbian Maya site a couple of kilometers south of the town of
        <em>Telchaquillo</em> in <em>Municipality of Tecoh,</em> approximately 40 km south-east of <em>Mérida</em> and 
        100 km west of <em>Chichen Itza;</em> in the state of <em>Yucatán, Mexico.</em> Mayapan was the political 
        and cultural capital of the Maya in the <em>Yucatán Peninsula</em> during the Late Post-Classic
        period from the 1220s until the  1440s. Estimates of the total city population are 
        15,000–17,000 persons, and the site has more than 4,000 structures within the city 
        walls, and additional dwellings outside.<br >The site has been professionally surveyed 
        and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 1939; five years of work was doneby\
        a team in the 1950s, and additional studies were done in the 1990s. Since 2000, a 
        collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery 
        at the site, which continue.</p>
